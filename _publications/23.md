The concept of quantum dots (QDs) traces back to the 1980s when researchers discovered that the properties of semiconductors 
  could be manipulated by reducing their size to the nanoscale. Since then, extensive research has been conducted to understand 
  and harness the unique properties of QDs for various applications. The size of QDs is on the order of a few nanometers (1â€“10 nm), 
  which leads to quantum confinement effects. These effects arise from the confinement of electrons and holes within the nanocrystal, 
  resulting in discrete energy levels. As a result, QDs exhibit size-dependent optical and electronic properties, such as tunable 
  absorption and emission wavelengths, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and excellent color purity.
