Light-triggered micro/nano drug delivery systems represent a remarkable advancement in the field of targeted drug delivery. 
  These systems harness the unique properties of light to achieve precise spatiotemporal control over drug release, enabling 
  enhanced therapeutic outcomes and minimizing undesirable side effects. The core principle of light-triggered drug delivery 
  involves the incorporation of photosensitive materials, such as photo-responsive polymers, nanoparticles (NPs), or liposomes, 
  into carrier systems that encapsulate therapeutic agents. These materials possess the ability to undergo reversible structural 
  changes in response to specific wavelengths of light. By carefully designing the carrier systems and selecting appropriate 
  light sources, researchers can achieve on-demand drug release at targeted sites within the body with exceptional precision. 
  This approach offers numerous benefits, including the potential to overcome biological barriers, reduce systemic toxicity, 
  and improve patient compliance. Moreover, the versatility of light-responsive materials allows for the development of 
  tailored drug delivery strategies, ranging from continuous release to pulsatile or even remotely triggered release profiles. 
  Photon energy has the potential to facilitate the creation, connection, breakdown, and heating of materials, contingent on 
  deliberately designed electronic structures and photon attributes. A promising method for treating diverse infections and 
  ailments involves the gentle administration of healing substances without causing harm. Additionally, the wide-ranging 
  possibilities in this field could involve the utilization of machine learning and gene-editing approaches to bolster the 
  intelligence of nano delivery systems.
