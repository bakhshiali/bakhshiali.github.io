In this research, a magnetic field sensor based on the tapered optical fiber was fabricated. The tapered area of the optical fiber was coated by the GO–Fe3O4
hybrid prepared through the electrostatic self-assembly. High sensitivity of 99–324 pW/mT was obtained for the taper lengths of 6.8–11 mm and taper diameters 
of 3.3–12.8 μm using a laser with a wavelength of 1550 nm (2 mW) and the magnetic flux density of 0–60 mT. It was found that the output power increased linearly 
as the magnetic field increased. Moreover, the sensor sensitivity increased linearly by increasing the taper length and decreasing the taper diameter due to an 
increase in the evanescent field penetration.
