This paper is about Solid State Spin. Here we provide the knowledge and science about quantum mechanics and qubits developments.
Considering the ever-increasing technological progress and the urgent need for fundamental knowledge to solve the fundamental challenges in the field of quantum
computers and sensors, research in the field of spin is necessary as an intrinsic fact. Spin can be considered as a fundamental property with the closest 
classical concept of angular momentum. Solid state spin is considered as a field to control electron and nucleus spin, which uses different materials and 
different methods to control spin-related phenomena. In this research, we are trying to create a sufficient vision in this field by briefly introducing the 
fundamental and modern knowledge of spin, which is the key to solving many of today's technological challenges, and then by introducing the time evolution of 
the initial ideas in the field of solid state spin qubits and sensors, to Let's discuss recent challenges and ideas in this field.
