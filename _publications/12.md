In the face of unprecedented global pandemics, the urgent need for effective antibacterial and antiviral agents has become paramount to combat infectious diseases. 
  Biopolymers have emerged as versatile and sustainable materials with significant antibacterial and antiviral properties, making them promising candidates for 
  combatting pandemics and infectious diseases. This context provides an overview of biopolymers and their crucial roles in pandemic prevention and therapy. 
  The introduction outlines the various types of biopolymers, their synthesis methods, and intrinsic properties, focusing on their antibacterial and antiviral 
  capabilities. It further explores the relationship between pandemics and the importance of harnessing biopolymers to tackle emerging infectious threats. 
  The subsequent sections delve into specific biopolymers and their derivatives, including polysaccharides, polypeptides, nucleic acids, and proteins, 
  elucidating their mechanisms of action and potential applications. The context then highlights the use of biopolymers in pandemic prevention, such 
  as air purification through respiratory masks, using shields, and eye glasses, as well as surface processing techniques like decontamination and coatings. 
  Furthermore, the biopolymer role in ensuring food security through packaging and antioxidant ingredients is discussed as humans need food which might be 
  infected in first place. Additionally, the biopolymer-based therapy applications get attention including drug, gene, and vaccine delivery. 
  Looking ahead, it worth to mention the future perspective of integrating recent scientific achievements like artificial intelligence in the biopolymer applications.
