The outbreak of COVID-19 disease, the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome, is considered a worldwide public health concern. 
  Although studies indicated that the virus could spread through respiratory particles or droplets in close contact, current research 
  have revealed that the virus stays viable in aerosols for several hours. Numerous investigations have highlighted the protective role 
  of air purifiers in the management of COVID-19 transmission, however, there are still some doubts regarding the efficiency and safety 
  of these technologies. According to those observations, using a proper ventilation system can extensively decrease the spread of COVID-19. 
  However, most of those strategies are currently in the experimental stages. This review aimed at summarising the safety and effectiveness of 
  the recent approaches in this field including using nanofibres that prevent the spread of airborne viruses like SARS-CoV-2. Here, the efficacy 
  of controlling COVID-19 by means of combining multiple strategies is comprehensively discussed.
