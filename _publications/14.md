Cutting-edge advancements in biomedical materials are embodied by antibacterial and antiviral nanofibrous membranes. 
  These sophisticated membranes, crafted through techniques such as electrospinning at the nanoscale, boast a high 
  specific surface area, fostering enhanced interactions with pathogens. Through the integration of antibacterial and 
  antiviral agents, such as nanoparticles or organic compounds, these membranes acquire potent antimicrobial properties. 
  The nanofibrous structure not only facilitates a sustained release of these agents but also fosters physical interactions 
  with microorganisms, disrupting their cell membranes and impeding proliferation. Moreover, the design of nanofibrous 
  architecture allows for efficient filtration, customizable to specific pore sizes, enabling the selective exclusion of 
  bacteria and viruses. Consequently, these nanofibrous membranes exhibit promising applications in various fields, 
  including wound dressings, air filtration systems, water purification, and protective clothing. Their dual-action 
  against bacteria and viruses is crucial in preventing infections and safeguarding public health. The primary challenge 
  lies in identifying and eradicating infections effectively. Nanofibrous sensors utilize responsive materials to translate 
  physical measurements into understandable information for humans, aiding in the detection of infectious microorganisms. 
  Stimuli-responsive nanofibers can be remotely controlled to release antimicrobial additives. Smart nanofibers exhibit 
  adaptability to complex environments. For instance, excess pressure on membranes can induce deformation and cracks, 
  which self-healing materials can address by releasing encapsulated materials to fill gaps and eliminate infections.
