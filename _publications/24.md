There are several synthesis methods for quantum dots (QDs), each with its own advantages and limitations. Here, we try to 
  cover the synthesis methods in three categories including chemical, physical, and biological routes. Viruses and fungi 
  could be exploited as tools in the QDs synthesis through biofabrication techniques. Cutting-edge applications of QDs 
  depend on controlled properties like purity, morphology, crystal structure, size, and chemical composition. Furthermore, 
  Postprocessing of QDs is crucial for specified applications including attaching or linking other molecules, such as 
  antibodies, peptides, or targeting ligands. This conjugation allows for the functionalization of QDs, enabling their 
  specific interaction with target molecules or cells. This chapter supplies an outline for the different synthesis approaches 
  employed in the fabrication of QDs, highlighting their advantages, limitations, and recent advancements. The synthesis process 
  involves the creation of nanoscale structures typically ranging from 1 to 10 nm in diameter, which exhibit quantum confinement 
  effects leading to discrete energy levels. By controlling the size and composition of these structures, researchers can tune 
  their electronic, optical, and magnetic properties.
