This paper is about Quantum electronics. Here we provide the knowledge and science about quantum mechanics and electron behaviour for laser and qubits developments. we also reviewed the nanotechnology integration as well.
Quantum electronics is the area of physics which is used to study the quantum mechanics of the electrons in matterials. Dealing with materials for innovative bleeding-edged devices is a inevitable criteria. Thus, studying and enlightenment of quantum confinment in nanoscale materials is important step for new semiconductors like Quantum dots, wires, and wells. This field let's us to to make direct band gap Si structures (IR to visible shift). Owing to this field, we could use colloidal quantum dots (CQDs),Q-wires, and Q-films in lasers and solar cells for further developments (better mode-locking, high temperature stabilities, multiple exciton generation (MEG) and etc.).
