Wound can be defined as a disruption or damage in the integrated structure of skin which can be observed as an 
  open or closed wound. Wound healing is a complex process that requires precise wound care without failure. 
  Nanomaterial-based therapies improve wound care by facilitating the healing process. Quantum dots (QDs) have 
  extraordinary properties as they are three-dimensional (3D) confined with a comparable radius to the exciton 
  Bohr radius. QDs possess the ability to monitor and promote the healing stages. Integration of QDs in bleeding-edge 
  technologies such as machine learning, microneedle delivery, microfluidics, and smart materials creates enhanced 
  wound-healing systems that eliminate challenges such as cross-contamination, pandemics, multi-drug loading and 
  diagnosis, feedback-based controlled release of drugs, and accurate stimuli-responsive nanocarriers. QD-based 
  wound dressing can be 3D/4D printed with stem cells on-demand and in-situ (nanofiber spinning) as an enhanced 
  personalized point-of-care system on the wound area.
