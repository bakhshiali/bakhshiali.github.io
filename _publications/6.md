This paper is about Diabetic retinopathy. Diabetes mellitus is common disease nowadays which could 
cause blindness. Earlier detection of diabetes signs from retina fundus images could help predicting 
and preventing the damages. Image processing methods could process the matrix data of pictures as 
blood vessel segmentation and exudate detection. In this research, the CLAHE algorithm with morphological 
transformations are used to blood vessel segmentation and determination of the Hessian matrix of images 
are utilized to detect the exudate blobs.
