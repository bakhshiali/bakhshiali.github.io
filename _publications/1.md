This paper is about "Superconducting qubits" recent developments. Quantum bits (qbits) are as simple as two-level states in theoretical view but practically, achieving these states in condensed matter could face technical challenges. Here in this review paper, we try to figure out what are the challenges and how we could overcome. <br>
