Recent advances in biosensor and bioelectronics technologies have revolutionized cancer diagnosis, providing more accessible,
  sensitive, and specific methods for early detection. This review focuses on polyaniline (PANI)-based biosensors, which demonstrate 
  significant potential in detecting cancer biomarkers due to their tunable properties, cost-effectiveness, and ease of synthesis. 
  Various PANI synthesis techniques, including chemical, electrochemical, enzyme-catalyzed, vapor-phase, and template-assisted 
  polymerization, are examined, along with the development of multidimensional PANI nanostructures to enhance biosensor performance. 
  Advanced 3D printing techniques have enabled the precise fabrication of PANI-based devices, such as flexible sensors, 
  high-performance supercapacitors, and electroactive scaffolds, showcasing PANI's versatility and potential in biomedical 
  and biosensor applications. The application of PANI-based biosensors in detecting lung, liver, breast, and prostate cancers 
  is discussed, highlighting the detection principles, limits, and specificity for each cancer type. Furthermore, the role of 
  PANI in signal amplification through nanocomposite (NC) integration, which improves diagnostic accuracy, is explored. 
  This comprehensive review also addresses the current challenges and future opportunities for advancements in PANI-based 
  biosensor technology, emphasizing its critical importance in the next generation of cancer diagnostics. By overcoming the 
  limitations of conventional diagnostic methods, these biosensors are positioned to play a pivotal role in improving early 
  cancer detection and patient outcomes.
