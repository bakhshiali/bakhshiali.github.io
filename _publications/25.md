Cancer theranostics, also known as oncology therapy and diagnostics, refers to the various treatment and diagnosis methods 
  and approaches used to combat cancer. These therapies aim to control or eliminate cancerous cells and tumors, with the 
  goal of improving patient outcomes and prolonging survival. Nanometer-scale luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals, 
  known as quantum dots (QDs), possess distinctive characteristics that make them attractive for potential applications 
  in oncology as diagnostic and therapeutic systems. These properties include exceptional brightness, high photostability, 
  real-time multiple signals detection, and the fine-tunable emission spectrum. Thus, higher temporal-spatial resolution 
  facilitates the targeting and diagnostics of cancer at molecular and cellular levels.
