In this study, a novel handheld battery-operated electrospinning device equipped with a nanofiber concentrator was developed 
  to enhance target area control during nanofiber deposition. The device manipulates the electric field using the dielectric 
  properties of a polymeric tunnel, enabling precise deposition of nanofibers with specific patterns. Low molecular weight 
  chitosan/poly(vinyl alcohol) (CS/PVA) nanofibers with an average diameter of 65 ± 9 nm were successfully synthesized. 
  Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations demonstrated the effectiveness of the nanofiber concentrator in stabilizing 
  the whipping jet, reducing deposition area, and increasing accuracy. Experimental results highlighted the impact of 
  parameters such as high voltage, collector distance, flow rate, and concentrator design on nanofiber morphology and deposition. 
  The developed device produced uniform nanofibers with minimized defects, optimal at a needle-collector distance of 10–15 cm. 
  Applications of this innovative device include wound dressing, tissue engineering, food packaging, and cosmetics, with potential 
  for direct-writing and 3D printing through modular concentrator designs. The lightweight, energy-efficient design also increases 
  practicality for portable and in-situ applications..
