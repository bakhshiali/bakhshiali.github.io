This chapter delves into the utilization of bioactive and biodegradable materials in the context of supercapacitors (SCs). 
  SCs are renowned for their high-power density, rapid charge/discharge capabilities and extended cycle life. However, 
  conventional SCs often rely on non-biodegradable materials, posing environmental and health concerns. In contrast, 
  bioactive and biodegradable SCs offer an environmentally friendly alternative by employing materials derived from natural sources, 
  capable of degradation through biological agents or environmental conditions, and interacting with biological systems. 
  The chapter covers four primary aspects of bioactive and biodegradable SCs. Firstly, it explores the selection and application 
  of various biodegradable polymers, such as polyesters, polycarbonates, polyurethanes, polysaccharides and proteins, as the 
  fundamental materials for SCs. Next, it delves into the synthesis and characterization of bioactive and biodegradable nanomaterials, 
  including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, metal oxides, metal sulphides, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and conductive polymers. 
  Integration of these nanomaterials into polymer matrices enhances the electrochemical performance of SCs. The chapter further discusses 
  the design and optimization of bioactive and biodegradable components within SCs, such as electrodes, electrolytes, substrates and 
  encapsulation materials. It assesses their biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical stability, thermal stability and electrical conductivity. 
  Moreover, it showcases the application of bioactive and biodegradable SCs in diverse fields like wearable electronics, implantable devices, 
  biosensors, drug delivery systems, and environmental remediation. Concluding the chapter, a discussion ensues regarding the current 
  challenges and future prospects of bioactive and biodegradable materials for SCs. By presenting a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art 
  research in this emerging field, the chapter aims to inspire novel ideas for developing sustainable and functional energy storage devices.
