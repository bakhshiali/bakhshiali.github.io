This paper is about quantum internet. Here we provide the knowledge and science about quantum mechanics and quantum internet developments.
The development of processing, network and communication technology infrastructure has led us to the term quantum internet. In this sense, 
  we are facing a quantum model. Quantum components in their simplest form include quantum computers, networked quantum processes and 
  communication media that exchange qubits, and for simplicity, this concept can be considered as the standard model of OSI (comprehensive) 
  or TCP/IP of current networks. In order to understand the emergence of the quantum internet era, we need to know the technology and science 
  of quantum networks, which is a requirement for quantum research to build the required equipment. In this research, we are trying to describe 
  the quantum internet technology and its challenges by briefly introducing the current quantum technologies and point to the implemented 
  practical projects. Due to the complexity of the nature of the subject and many terms, it has been tried to present the material in the 
  simplest form with examples and to avoid presenting formulas.
