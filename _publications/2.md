The 3D self-supporting nano-structures are promising materials to impact the real 3D challenges in mechanical and thermal properties which nano-materials could be utilized as the main structures (not as filler or additives).
Further research ideas to discover could be the 3D Magnetic structures in biomedical therapy, actuators, sensors, water purification, alternative magnetic field induced heat generation, magnetic shape memory, corrosion-resistant, and various remote-controlled properties.
