The 3D self-supporting nano-structures are promising materials to impact the real 3D challenges in mechanical and thermal properties which nano-materials could be utilized as the main structures (not as filler or additives).<br>
Further research ideas to discover could be the 3D Magnetic structures in biomedical therapy, actuators, sensors, water purification, alternative magnetic field induced heat generation, magnetic shape memory, corrosion-resistant, and various remote-controlled properties.
