Here we were taking a deeper look at Graphene.

Principles (6 sessions)
======
1) Structure and properties (mechanical, optical, etc.)
2) Molecular dynamics simulation
3) Production and coating methods
4) Material recycling (flash graphene, pyrolysis, etc.)
5) Advanced applications (medicine, quantum computer, waveguide, transistor, etc.)
6) Inventions and innovations
