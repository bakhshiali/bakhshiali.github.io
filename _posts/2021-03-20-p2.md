An Introduction
======
CATIA (an acronym of computer-aided three-dimensional interactive application) is a multi-platform software suite for computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), computer-aided engineering (CAE), PLM and 3D, developed by the French company Dassault Systèmes.
CATIA started as an in-house development in 1977 by French aircraft manufacturer AVIONS MARCEL DASSAULT, at that time customer of the CADAM software to develop Dassault’s Mirage fighter jet. It was later adopted by the aerospace, automotive, shipbuilding, and other industries.
