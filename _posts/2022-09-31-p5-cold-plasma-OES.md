OES Code

An Introduction
======
Optical emission spectrum (OES) is a collected data from spectral dispersion 
which is gathered from light emission of objects. Here, the cold plasma emits 
light which can be detected using CCD camera and series of lenses 
(usually fused-silica).  

This analysis can be used to detect elements by applying an electric discharge 
to vaporize chemicals which finally generates plasma emission (e.g. ICP-OES). 
The electron transition between energy levels emits specific photon (E=hv=hf).
The collected data is related to specific elements (atoms + ions), so we can 
find the unknown peaks using NIST database.

Code
======
I tried to write a code to locate peaks of cold plasma for accurate analysis of 
optical emission spectra (OES) of plasma.<br>
sample data: Argon plasma reference data: NIST Argon peaks-observed wavelength 
in air<br>
