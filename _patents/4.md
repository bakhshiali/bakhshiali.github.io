abstract:<br>
<p align="justify" style="padding-left: 1em">The increased public interest in consuming therapeutic foods, combined with advancements in scientific research, 
  has driven consumers to prioritize the role of healthy foods in enhancing their overall well-being. As a result, food technology has pivoted towards creating higher quality, 
  more nutritious food options. The development of plant-based analog ice cream offers health-conscious and convenient properties, devoid of animal fat. Not only does it enhance 
  the sensory aspects of ice cream, particularly its texture and color, owing to its plant-based protein and fat, but it also holds a unique appeal for consumers, particularly 
  those adhering to a vegetarian diet or dealing with lactose sensitivity. This type of ice cream represents an innovative product, presenting a promising consumer market for 
  food industry producers. Beyond economic benefits, introducing this snack product could provide a fresh opportunity to diversify the range of plant-based products, increase 
  per capita legume consumption, reshape consumer preferences, especially among children, and gradually acquaint individuals with the consumption of legumes and natural products.<p>
