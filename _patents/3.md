abstract:<br>
<p align="justify" style="padding-left: 1em">Extraction of widely used and useful materials from natural resources causes a reduction in 
  cost, time, warehouse, etc. in various industries such as pharmaceutical, food, textile, etc. Chitin and chitosan are important and widely 
  used polymers in water purification, packaging, food, textile, agriculture, medicine, medicine, papermaking, etc., which are found in 
  natural materials such as mushrooms, yeasts, insect cuticles, and the exoskeleton of arthropods such as shrimp, crab, etc. Traditional 
  methods use expensive and harmful chemicals or enzymes to extract chitin and chitosan. Chitosan is chitin with a deacetylation degree above 50%,
  which is also known as chitosan oligosaccharides with shorter chains. The current industrial method by integrating microwave waves and 
  cold plasma in the process of chitin and chitosan extraction, such as the steps of removing minerals, protein and deacetylation, 
  increases the percentage of extraction, quality and control of the process and reduces the time, steps, energy consumption for 
  extraction and cost. For this reason, chitosan oligosaccharides can be obtained for medical applications, especially pharmaceuticals, 
  with a higher production yield. The system can be monitored and controlled by industrial controllers with all kinds of industrial networks 
  and even in Internet of Things mode. According to an extraction example, chitosan with a high deacetylation degree of >95% has been 
  extracted from shrimp shell in less than 30 minutes.<p>
