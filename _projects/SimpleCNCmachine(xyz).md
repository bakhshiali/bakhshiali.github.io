<h2>What is simple CNC machine (x y z)?</h2>

<p align="justify" style="padding-left: 1em">The meaning of CNC is Computer Numerical Control. It means the computer can convert the design that is produced by a Computer Aided Design application into numbers. These numbers are actually coordination of a graph and they are capable of controlling the movement of CNC cutters. In this way, the computer can control the cutting and shaping of the materials.</p>

<p align="justify" style="padding-left: 1em">We could name different types, to be general in industry there are two main types of CNC machining systems: milling and turning. Each is better suited for manufacturing different geometriesCNC milling is the most popular CNC machine architecture. In CNC milling, the part is mounted onto the bed and material is removed using rotational cutting tools.</p>

<p align="justify" style="padding-left: 1em">In CNC turning systems (also known as lathes), the part is mounted on a rotating chuck and material is removed using stationary cutting tools. This way parts with symmetry along their center axis can be manufactured. Turned parts are typically produced faster (and at a lower cost) than milled parts.</p>

<p align="justify" style="padding-left: 1em">Non-cylindrical parts can be manufactured using modern multi-axis CNC turning centers, which are also equipped with CNC milling tools. These systems combine the high productivity of CNC turning with the capabilities of CNC milling and can manufacture a very large range of geometries with (looser) rotational symmetry, such as camshafts and radial compressor impellers.</p>

<p align="justify" style="padding-left: 1em">I’ve assembled a simple CNC as portfolio for my future works. Due to sanctions on IRAN, I had to stop these projects as all components got double and much more in price (stepper motors & Texas instrument’s ICs , …) . I hope this project will be done in future!</p>
