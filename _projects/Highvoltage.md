High voltage

Plasma needs high voltages and vacuum. To get plasma working in atmosphere pressure We need some skills in electronics such transistors, diodes, resistors and etc to know how to build or design a circuit for our system. first step is simulating or designing the system in computer so we need to know about softwares like : Proteus, Altium Designer or Cadence for special ICs for ourselves and etc.

I’d try to build ozone machine, plasma hardening, plasma cleaning stuffs but due to their high price in machining, quarts/Pyrex tubes, vacuum pumps (rotary or …) and no sponsor in this field I’d to stop these projects here and I hope to finish these portfolios one day. (circuits will be uploaded as soon as possible)
