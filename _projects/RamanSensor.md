<h2>Raman Sensor-medical application</h2>

<p align="justify" style="padding-left: 1em">Raman spectroscopy is becoming one of the most popular analytical measurement tools for pharmaceutical applications ranging from verification of raw materials to process monitoring of drug production to quality control of products.<br>

Historically, the developments of Raman tools were also augmented by the discoveries of various phenomena other than the basic Raman effect, such as resonance Raman (RR), coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).<br>

As explained in ” https://bakhshiali.com/skills/gaussview/ ” we have several modes in molecules of medicines so with different shifts in frequencies we could get fingerprints like “XRD standard cards” called “local Raman standard cards” then with supervised learning algorithms, Our AI will extract all information from Raman peak’s positions, displacements, polarization, width and intensity like grain orientations, stress/strain, plastic deformations and etc., in pharmaceutical applications we get :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Raw Material Identification on the Dock, at the Dispensary, and at the Hopper</li>
  <li>Real-time Monitoring of Granulation, Blending, Drying, and Coating</li>
  <li>Non-destructive Tablets, Gel-caps, and Liquid Formulation Analysis</li>
<ul>
