<h2>Simple android programs</h2>

<p align="justify" style="padding-left: 1em">Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel. It is free and open source software; its source code is known as Android Open Source Project (AOSP).</p>

<h3>1) Azarsky app</h3>

<p align="justify" style="padding-left: 1em">This app’s been made for our company named “Azarsky” to make online show as new carpets were passed final finishing (technically an offline/online show with secure connection to website/server to update databases/resources). Despite my efforts to save & improve company, my dad wasn’t eager to see future!</p>

<p align="justify" style="padding-left: 1em">I used to build my applications with Eclipse IDE and now all of it is integrated in android studio (Google’s Android operating system IDE built on JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA). As seen in above picture, we could use “Android Emulator” to try our apps on many platforms or online in our phone connected to the PC.</p>

<h3>2) Hack app (security test)</h3>

<p align="justify" style="padding-left: 1em">I was curious to make apps to remove “login walls” like “Sci-hub” so I tried to make this app to try “dictionary attack”, “password cracking”, etc. on WiFi networks, … .</p>

<p align="justify" style="padding-left: 1em">As you could see, this app was launched on Pixel-XL smartphone and there is a opened menu in right of app and user could specify the target and change the settings of “brute force” or etc. attacks.</p>
