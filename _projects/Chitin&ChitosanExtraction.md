<h2>What is Chitin & Chitosan?</h2>

<p align="justify" style="padding-left: 1em">Chitosan is a sugar (linear polysaccharide) composed of <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Chitosan">
deacetylated beta-1,4-D-glucosamine</a> which is deacetylated form of chitin. Literally, chitosan has a degree of deacetylation (DD%) >50% which is obtained after 
deacetylation stage. Chitin, as a second abundant natural polysaccharide after cellulose, is a main component of exoskeletons of arthropods, the cell walls of fungi, 
insects, and etc (Table 1). Chitin has 3 polymorphic forms including α- (anti-parallel, most abundant, highly crystalline, strong H-bonding insoluble), 
β- (parallel, weak H-bounding, unstable, water soluble), and γ-chitin (mixture of α and β).<br>
The chemical structure of chitin consists of repeating Glucosamines linked 
with a glycosidic oxygen (O-glycosides); glucose part in chitin have an amyl group linked (NHCOCH$_{3}$ or N-acetyl group) -instead of a hydroxyl group (OH) in cellulose- that consists 
of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) atoms. Nitrogen has an electrically positive charge, while the oxygen (double bonded to the N-acetyl group) is electrically negative. 
Referring to electromagnetic courses, this two separate but spatially close enough atoms can be interpreted as a dipole in the molecule, which increases the hydrogen bond's 
possibilities which is formed between molecules. When we mix chitin solution with a composite-matrix consisting of various compounds, the resulting structure can be 
mechanically hard because of all the weak interactions between neighbor molecules. Naturally, chitin is insoluble in water and after deacetylation phase, the 
chitosan has acid solubility properties thus various modified chitosan methods are conducted to modify primary/secondary hydroxy and primary amino functional groups 
(remove, charge change, quaternization, substitution) through temperature, pH (protonation), hydrolysis, surface modification with free radicals/cold Plasma and etc.

<h2>Chitosan Oligosaccharide (COS)</h2>

<p align="justify" style="padding-left: 1em">
COS is an oligomer of β-(1➔4)-linked d-glucosamine which can be synthesized using chitosan degradation (acidic, enzymatic, oxidative, and radiation).
thus, COS has low molecular weight (~<2kDa), higher DD%, enhanced degree of polymerization (DP), and water solubility which can be absorbed in intestine 
or excreted with the urine. With lower electronegativity of N-atoms, amino groups has greater nucleophilic properties. Cationic COS can interact
electrostatically with negatively charged entities like cell membranes (permeability change, disruption and etc.). COS shows better blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
penetration ability (Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment candidate).

<h2>Chitin & Chitosan Extraction</h2>

<p align="justify" style="padding-left: 1em">
According to literature, chitosan has vast applications (Table 2) due to incredible properties (Non-toxic, biodegradable, biocompatible, cytocompatible, anti-microbial, 
anti-cholestrolemic, anti-oxidant, anti-inflamatory, analgestic, hemostatic activities, mucoadhesion, angiogenesis stimulatory, macrophase activation, 
adsorption enhancer) [<a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/polym3041875">1</a>].

<h3>Chemical Extraction</h3>

<p align="justify" style="padding-left: 1em">
Technically, the chitin source get through various stages as separation (washing, Crashing/Grinding), purification (deproteinization, demineralization, decolorization), 
deacetylation, degradation. For example, shrimp gets purchased, shrimp shell gets separated, washed by hot water, grinned to get desired particles (by considering filtering No.), 
deproteinized (also lipid removing) by alkali solution (~5% NaOH or KOH + Heat), demineralized (CaCO$_{3}$, ... removing) by acidic solutions (e.g. ~ 30%HCl or equivalent H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$, acetic acid), 
decolorized by oxidation (H$_{2}$O$_{2}$), deacetylated by alkali solution (stronger NaOH + heat (for faster results)), degraded by various techniques to get COS.<br>

Extraction route depends on source and final market applications; for example in fungal mycelium, the processed are 10% NaOH, acetic acid, glucanases, 50% NaOH to get 
our final gel which after 10% NaOH, solubilized proteins, lipids, pigments and hemicelluloses get washed out.
